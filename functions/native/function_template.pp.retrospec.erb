# Example Documention for function using puppet strings

# When given two numbers, returns the one that is larger.
# You could have a several line description here if you wanted,
# but I don't have much to say about this function.
#
# @example using two integers
#   $bigger_int = max(int_one, int_two)
#
# @return [Integer] the larger of the two parameters
#
# @param num_a [Integer] the first number to be compared
# @param num_b [Integer] the second number to be compared
